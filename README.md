# pysc2_Project
Repository for the Starcraft 2 API pysc2

# Preface

This project is part of the bachelor degree program at the University of Applied Sciences in Fulda, Germany.
Our goal is to extract data from Starcraft 2 matches on the basis of pysc2 to use it later for machine learning methods.
Therefore we will create simple bots to test the pysc2-interface and collect simple datasets. In addition to this we want
to collect data from Starcraft 2 replays, as well as games with real players.

The features we are planning to extract are:
* race
* unit counts
* building counts
* tech status
* resources
* apm
* win-lose information at the end of a match
